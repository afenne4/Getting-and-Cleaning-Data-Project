## Project Description
This project utilizes data about movement from a small group of participants

## Study design and data processing
30 participants had a smartphone attached to their waist, while they performed
6 physical activities (Walking, Standing, etc.). Information from the
accelerometer and gyroscope on the phone was collected. This data was filtered
to reduce the influence of noise and to separate the signals into various 
components of interest.


### Raw data 
Participant identification number, physical activity (Walking, Walking upstairs,
Walking downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying), and a 561 feature vector with
time and frequency domain variables. Details on this feature vector can be found
in features_info.txt file. 

## Processing data
Filtered the data to only select columns that contain the means or standard
deviations as specified by the variable name (see features.txt). Replaced numeric
values corresponding to physical activity with character descriptors using the 
activity_labels.txt file. Underscores were removed to make downstream analyses 
simpler. Variable names were selected from the features.txt file and had non 
alpha numeric characters removed. The t and f at the beggining of the
variable names were expanded to time and freq respectively in an effort to be 
more explicit about their meaning. The average was calculated for each subject
in each condition across all the measured variables and written to a text file
called Tidy_Data.txt.
